# **Minimum Wages through Ages:**
A project to understand the changes to the federal, state and effective minimum wages across the United States. This project aims to visualise the change in wages from the years 1968 to 2020.

Minimum wage is the lowest wage per hour that a worker may be paid as mandated by the federal law. In the United States, states and the federal government set minimum hourly pay or a minimum wage that ensures a  quality of life that its citizens are bound to. Increased minimum wages aids the increase in productivity, company turnovers and the economy. Even though the United States enforces a federal minimum wage, individual states, cities, and localities may pass different minimum wage requirements provided the stipulated hourly wage is not lower than the federal minimum wage. The decided minimum wage of a state is indicative of the specific state's cost of living. 

Multiple factors influence the selected minimum wage. Some of these include:
<li> Inflation
<li> Gross Regional Domestic Product
<li> Employment Figures
<li> Poverty Threshold

We analyse this data using three visualizations
#### 1. An interactive choropleth map which indicates the average state wages since the past 5 years across all states.

#### 2. An interactive bar chart that displays either the state minimum wage, federal minimum wage, or effective minimum wage for a specific year that is chosen with the help of a slider.

#### 3. An interactive scatter plot that displays either the state minimum wage, federal minimum wage, or effective minimum wage for a specific year that is chosen with the help of a slider.

These visualizations have been deployed as a streamlit app with the help of altair and python.
